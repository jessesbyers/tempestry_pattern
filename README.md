# TempestryPattern

The Tempestry Pattern Gem was designed to automatically generate patterns for knitting or crocheting climate data.

Users input a zip code and a year, and the program scrapes the daily maximum temperature for each day that year, and converts that temperature to the corresponding color for representing that day in a fiber arts project.

Users can save their patterns with a name and description, and view/print all patterns at a later date.

See The Tempestry Project for examples and more details: https://www.tempestryproject.com

Weather data derived from the National Climatic Data Center, scraped via the Old Farmer's Almanac:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tempestry_pattern'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tempestry_pattern

## Usage

NOTE: The full version of this gem takes approximately 20 minutes to scrape a full year's worth of weather data.

Use the Demo Version (demo branch) to explore all features of the program with a smaller amount of data. After installation

$ git checkout demo

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
